# Photography Portfolio Website

<b><i>Apstract</i></b>

All of us in our everyday life, meet all kinds of marketing ads, from billboards, television commercials for products, 
fashion shows for the latest fashion collections to catalogs of products in markets, various travel - brochures, etc. 
A common thing for all of these types of ads is the reputation (how will the company be seen as) and the look of the ad, with that, 
a lot of service businesses had to find a way to self-advertise their work. Photographers are one of them.
In the past, they shared their work through a printed way, but over the years, with the entrance of the so-called online-age, 
online portfolios appeared and at the same time have become very popular. This made it possible to quickly share your service and create
good marketing strategy.

In a world where everybody lives on the Internet, with a bit of technical knowledge, creativity and a good idea you can
make a portfolio that will reach a large number of people and inspire others to repeat the same.

This is a project for my web design course where I made a photography portfolio website, using HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery.
